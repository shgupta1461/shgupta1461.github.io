Hi there ✌️ nice to meet you! I'm an _AI Engineer_ at [ISIR AI](https://www.isir.ai/) based out of Noida, India.

I'm an aspiring Data Science Engineer passionate about building intelligent, human-centric AI systems. My expertise lies in machine learning, deep learning, generative AI, and large language models (LLMs), where I focus on developing scalable AI-driven solutions. I have experience in retrieval-augmented generation (RAG), multi-agent architectures and deploying AI models efficiently using vector databases and cloud infrastructure like AWS.

I believe that AI should be both powerful and intuitive, seamlessly integrating into real-world applications. My work spans the entire AI lifecycle—from data preprocessing and model training to inference optimization and deployment—ensuring solutions that are not only accurate but also practical and impactful.

Outside of work and beyond coding, I enjoy playing car racing games and watching final cricket match only if India is one of the team.
